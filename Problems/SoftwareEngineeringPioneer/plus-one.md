## 66. Plus One

The "Plus One" problem is a common algorithmic challenge where you are given a list of non-negative integers representing a non-negative integer. The task is to add one to the integer and return the resulting list of digits.

### Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers `digits`, where each element in the list corresponds to a single digit of a large non-negative integer. The list does not contain any leading zeroes except for the number `0` itself. Your task is to increment the integer by `1` and return the resulting list of digits.

### Example
```python
Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123. Incrementing it by 1 gives 124.
```

```python
Input: digits = [9, 9, 9]
Output: [1, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 999. Incrementing it by 1 gives 1000.
```

### Approach

The solution uses an in-place algorithm to increment the number by `1`. The key challenge is to handle the carry that may occur when adding `1` to the last digit or multiple digits if they are `9`.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize the carry:**
   - Start with a carry of `1` since we are adding one to the number.

2. **Iterate through the digits from right to left:**
   - For each digit, add the carry to it.
   - Update the digit with the remainder when divided by `10`.
   - Calculate the new carry as the result of integer division by `10`.

3. **Handle any remaining carry:**
   - After processing all digits, if there is still a carry (e.g., all digits were `9`), insert the carry at the beginning of the list.

### Code with Comments
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        carry = 1  # Start with a carry of 1, because we need to add 1 to the number
        n = len(digits)  # Length of the digits list
        pos = n - 1  # Start from the last digit

        # Iterate over the digits from right to left
        while pos >= 0 and carry:
            newVal = digits[pos] + carry  # Add carry to the current digit
            carry, digits[pos] = newVal // 10, newVal % 10  # Update carry and the current digit
            pos -= 1  # Move to the next digit on the left

        # If there's still a carry left (e.g., the original digits were all 9s)
        if carry:
            return [carry] + digits  # Add the carry to the front
        return digits  # Return the modified digits list
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The algorithm processes each digit exactly once, where `n` is the length of the input list `digits`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The solution modifies the input list in place, so no additional space proportional to the input size is required.

### Comparison with Alternative Solutions

#### Alternative Solution: Conversion to Integer

Another way to solve this problem is by converting the list of digits to an integer, adding one, and then converting it back to a list of digits.

```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        num = int(''.join(map(str, digits))) + 1
        return [int(d) for d in str(num)]
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The conversion operations involve iterating over the digits.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - The conversion to and from string/integer requires additional space proportional to the size of the input.

#### Comparison

- **Efficiency:** The original solution is more efficient because it works in-place without the need for additional space for conversions.
- **Performance:** The original solution is generally faster, especially for large inputs, because it avoids the overhead of converting between data types.
- **Readability:** The alternative solution is more concise, but the original solution is more explicit and easier to understand in terms of algorithmic steps.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity for the "Plus One" problem. It is recommended to use the original solution as it avoids unnecessary conversions and operates efficiently on the input list. The alternative solution, while more concise, is less efficient and should be avoided for large inputs.
