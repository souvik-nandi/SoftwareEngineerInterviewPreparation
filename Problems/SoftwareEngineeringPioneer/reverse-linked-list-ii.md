## 92. Reverse Linked List II

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `1 <= left <= right <= n` (`n` is the length of the linked list), reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

### Problem Examples

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4`
- **Output:** `[1,4,3,2,5]`
- **Explanation:** Nodes from position 2 to 4 are reversed.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `head = [5], left = 1, right = 1`
- **Output:** `[5]`
- **Explanation:** Since the linked list contains only one element, there's no need to reverse anything.

### Possible Solutions

1. **In-place Reversal Between Two Positions**

### Solution 1: In-place Reversal Between Two Positions

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        curNode = head
        prevLeftNode = None
        count = 1

        # Traversing to the node just before 'left'
        while curNode and count < left:
            prevLeftNode = curNode
            curNode = curNode.next
            count += 1
        
        # Reverse nodes from 'left' to 'right'
        reversedPrevNode = None
        reversedNodeStart = curNode

        while curNode and count <= right:
            tempNode = curNode
            curNode = curNode.next
            tempNode.next = reversedPrevNode
            reversedPrevNode = tempNode
            count += 1

        # Connect the reversed part with the rest of the list
        if prevLeftNode:
            prevLeftNode.next = reversedPrevNode
        else:
            head = reversedPrevNode

        reversedNodeStart.next = curNode

        return head
```

#### Algorithm Description

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the head node and a counter `count` to track the current node's position.
   - Traverse the list until reaching the node just before the `left` position (`prevLeftNode`).

2. **Reversing the Sublist**:
   - From the `left` node, reverse the nodes until reaching the `right` node. Keep track of the start of the sublist to be reversed (`reversedNodeStart`) and the previous reversed node (`reversedPrevNode`).

3. **Reconnecting the List**:
   - After reversing the sublist, reconnect the `prevLeftNode` to the last node of the reversed sublist (`reversedPrevNode`).
   - Connect the end of the reversed sublist (`reversedNodeStart`) to the node following the `right` position (`curNode`).

4. **Returning the New Head**:
   - If the `left` position is 1, the new head of the list will be `reversedPrevNode`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - The list is traversed twice: once to reach the `left` position and once to reverse the sublist. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the number of nodes `n`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for pointers and temporary variables.

#### Potential Pitfalls

1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Ensure that the function handles cases where `left` is 1 correctly, as this changes the head of the list.
   - Handle the case where `left == right`, as no changes should be made to the list.
   
2. **Null Pointers**: 
   - Be cautious with pointers when reconnecting nodes after the reversal, as incorrect handling may lead to a broken linked list.

### Conclusion

The in-place reversal approach is optimal for reversing a sublist within a linked list. It provides a clean solution with a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(1)`, making it efficient for large lists. This solution handles various edge cases, including when `left` is at the start of the list or when no reversal is needed.
