# System Design Problems

These examples involve complex architectures, sophisticated algorithms, and challenging scalability and reliability requirements. Prepare for these scenarios by understanding the underlying principles, trade-offs, and best practices in system design. Additionally, practice breaking down these systems into smaller components and explaining your design decisions during interviews.
